# Topic-Modelling-using-Python
Topic Modelling means assigning topic labels to a collection of text documents. The goal of topic modelling is to identify topics present in the text documents. 
Project Overview
This project focuses on Topic Modelling using Python to uncover hidden topics within text documents. The goal is to extract meaningful topics from a collection of articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is employed to assign topic labels to documents based on word patterns.

Data Processing
Loading Data:
A dataset of articles is loaded from a CSV file.
Text Preprocessing:
Lowercasing: All text is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Punctuation Removal: Removes special characters to avoid noise in the data.
Tokenization: Splits text into individual words.
Stopword Removal: Removes common words (like "the", "and") that do not add much meaning.
Lemmatization: Converts words to their base form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").

Methods Used
Text Vectorization:
TF-IDF Vectorizer: Converts text into numerical vectors, capturing word importance across documents.
Topic Modelling Algorithm:
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):
Identifies topics by finding patterns in word usage.
The number of topics (n_components) is set to 5, meaning the algorithm will group the documents into 5 distinct topics.

Results
Topic Assignment:
The LDA algorithm assigns topic labels to each article.
Example output shows which topic label each article belongs to based on the patterns identified.

Summary
This project demonstrates the use of NLP and machine learning techniques to assign topic labels to articles. LDA successfully uncovers hidden topics by analyzing word patterns and relationships. With proper preprocessing and text vectorization, topic modeling becomes a powerful tool for extracting insights from large textual datasets.
